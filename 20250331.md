## Ideas

#### Adolfo's Idea: Event Organizer

One Liner: It is an assessment for event organizers.

#### Margo's Idea: Work Life Balance App

One Liner:

App for scheduling activities: sports, events to create a work life balance.

Target audience: workaholics.

###### Questions

Is it like a calendar where you can log things? Yes, but there will be a pi chart describing how much time you spend on work, family, and leisure.

Have we done research on what ratio of activities to keep in order to have a work life balance? No, but we can look into it.

Is it a scheduled and tracking app? Yes, but it is more of a scheduling app.

###### Suggestions

Analyzed your specific schedule, and then give you a recommendation on how to balance your time. (Integration with calendar?)

"Could be better as a widget than as a stand alone app"

#### Aldo's Idea: Apply AI

One Liner: It is a web app that scrapes jobs from the web and provides it to the user.

Sounds like three solutions to a single problem.

Scraping could break.

Maybe we can consider using a third party API to get the data for an MVP.

#### Natalie's 1st Idea: Inventory Tracker

An inventory tracking app with a variety units: percent, packets, etc. Set exp. dates. Don't need to consistently update the app.

Business model (freemium): AI recipe generator, grocery list generator, scan checks with the app.

###### Suggestions

Can integrate with food tracking apps.
Can use OCR to scan food and remove it from the inventory.

Adaptation to embedded software.

#### Natalie's 2st Idea: Nomad Pay

Select city to see your gross paycheck for that city including inflation. So far, no such thing as a tax rate API. Can be useful for B2B in terms of companies to justify a minimum number.

Natalie already got the data for the US.

#### Maya's Idea
